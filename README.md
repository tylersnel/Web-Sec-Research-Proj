# Web-Sec-Research-Proj
Website Security Research Project for CS 467

Our goal is to create a simple web application to attempt various attacks on the web app and then harden the app to prevent the attack from happening again. On this Github repo there will be a write-up on how to perform each attack and the steps we took to prevent the attack. We will have 2 versions of the web app running on the server one of which will have the vulnerabilities and the other will not.  Our web app will have the option to turn the vulnerabilities on or off.
